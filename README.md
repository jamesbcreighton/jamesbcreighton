- 👋 Hi, I’m @jamesbcreighton
- 👀 I’m interested in creating an application by which other attorneys can enter information about their clients, which information is then "married" with my legal templates to produce a customized Microsoft Word document for them to download into their systems.
- I'm currently learning how best to accomplish my objective, as described immediately above.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on document generator applications.
- 📫 How to reach me: I can be reached at james@creightonlaw.com.
